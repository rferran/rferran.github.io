I'm Roger Ferran, a Systems Administrator from Barcelona.

In 2014 I started my studies in Computer Science, but after 2 years of hard working I realize that what I really wanted to do is to administrate computer systems, so I changed my plans and started studying System Administration in Escola del Treball in Barcelona.

I have always tried to ensure that the passion and enthusiasm for my work has shone through and also found that it is through a team that I have achieved my greatest potential.

Welcome to my personal portfolio, hope you enjoy it!
