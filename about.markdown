Roger Ferran, a Systems Administrator and student of Computer Science at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. Currently working as a systems administrator in end customer.

Experience in management and resolving incidents in a call center. Maintenance of Linux and Windows platforms.

Projects related to web development and development of new applications are what motivate me the most. Inquisitiveness about new Cloud Computing tools such as AWS or Google Cloud.

Welcome to my personal portfolio, hope you enjoy it!
